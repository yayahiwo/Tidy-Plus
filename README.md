<H1>Thanks and Credit to https://github.com/slavabarkov for the original Tidy</H1>

<p>I needed the app to do a little bit more than the original Tidy to help me organize and clean my big photo collection, And with the help of AI I was able to add the following functionality:</p>

<ul>
<li> Added image-to-image similarity threshold control slider.</li>
<li> Added multi-select in the grid (long-press to enter selection mode + checkboxes/overlay).</li>
<li> Added bulk Delete for selected photos using Android’s system permission flow (MediaStore delete requests/recoverable permission).</li>
<li> Added bulk Move for selected photos using folder picker + write permission (updates RELATIVE_PATH; primary storage support).</li>
<li> Added automatic index cleanup when photos are deleted (removes them from the Room CLIP index + in- memory lists).</li>
<li> Added a persistent “folders to index” setting.</li>
<li> Changed startup so the app doesn’t auto-index immediately; it waits for folder selection and a Start action (with auto-prompt on first run).</li>
<li> Added indexing progress + indexed count display.</li>
<li> Added re-index progress UI directly in the search screen after folder changes, and auto-refreshes the grid when indexing finishes.</li>
<li> Added pinch-to-zoom for the thumbnails grid</li>
<li> Made the grid remember its zoom level (persists the current column count across navigation).</li>
<li> Fixed grid visuals: square thumbnails (no stretching) and uniform 2px spacing horizontally/vertically.</li>
<li> In image-to-image results, added dimensions under each thumbnail (e.g., 800x600) and only show them for those results.</li>
<li> Added a Back button to return from image-to-image results to the full “all images” grid.</li>
<li> Improved the single-image screen: shows file location, file size, and pixel dimensions under the image.</li>
<li> Updated single-image UI controls: BACK button, Find Similar button, and added icons (search icon on Find Similar; close icon on BACK).</li>
<li> Fixed dark mode readability in single-image screen (text uses theme colors) and made the image background black in dark theme.</li>
<li> Enabled/configured pinch-to-zoom on the single image view (PhotoView scales).</li>
<li> Adjusted single-image navigation so swipe-to-next/previous is handled via PhotoView’s fling callback (and doesn’t break pinch zoom).</li>
<li> Converted the top-row search screen buttons to icon-only buttons (Search, Back, Clear, Folders) with appropriate icons.</li>
<li> Updated Gradle config so the project builds with AGP’s Java 17+ requirement (points Gradle to Android Studio’s bundled JDK).</li>
<li> Added Find near-duplicates tool.</li>
<li> Added library Stats display.</li> 
</ul>
